"Development of Social Storyboard Technology for Highly Satisfactory Cultural and Tourist Contents based on Unstructured Value Data Spidering" is the project funded by in South Korea which aims to extract useful information about travels from social media and utilize it to recommend the right schedule given the user queries (time, place, occasion and sentiment). I participated as a researcher to analyze the relationship of tourist spots and social reaction in terms of TPO (time, place, and occasion) and sentiment and design an algorithm to recommend a spot for specific TPO and sentiment queries using the concepts of network science.
