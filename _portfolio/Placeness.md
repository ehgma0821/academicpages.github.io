"Development of Data Mining Core Technologies for Real-time Intelligent Information Recommendation in Smart Spaces" is the project funded by in South Korea which aims to extract the social experiences (social interactions, emotional reactions, etc.) on the city spots from social media (instagram, twitter and foursquare). I participated as a researcher to analyze the relationship between the city spots and the social experience and come up with an algorithm to rank the right spot given the query from ambient IoT sensors and users' smartphones.
